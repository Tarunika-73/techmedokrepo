# CSS Bootcamp – Days 1–7

This repo contains 12 tasks with clean, beginner‑friendly HTML and external CSS for practicing core-to-advanced CSS topics.

Open each HTML file directly in your browser, or serve with any static server.

## Structure
- Day1 … Day7 — tasks grouped by day.
- assets/images — placeholder images (SVGs).
- Each task has `taskX-*.html` and a paired `taskX-*.css` file.

## Notes
- Google Fonts are loaded via `<link>` tags.
- Images are local placeholders so the pages work offline.
- The TechToday site (Day 6) is mobile‑first and fully responsive with Grid + Flexbox.
